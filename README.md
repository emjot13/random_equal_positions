# Random yet equal positions

## Motivation

This repository is a little side project, just for fun.

The idea behind it is to create random, unusual chess, yet equal chess positions.

I thought that such positions would be first of all - more interesting but also they can minimize the impact of knowing openings better by one of the opponents and so on.
That should favour the more cunning player rather the one who just studied more.

The idea is similar to chess 960, also called Fischer's Chess.

## STATUS

At the moment it's just a beginning, more of an idea at this point rather than implementation.
